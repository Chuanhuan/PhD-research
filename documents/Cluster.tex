\section{Introduction}
The key tasks of Machine Learning composit of variety field such as classification, segmentation and moden techenique, generative model.  
One of the foundamental skill for machine Learning is classification. To be more specific, two category can be divided is labeled data and unlableled data. 
This have many techenique from supervice and unsupervice learning. One of key feature is clustering which is an algorithm to cluster the data into different groups.
Generallly speaking, clustering is a unsupervise learning. The goal of clustering is to group the data into different clusters.
