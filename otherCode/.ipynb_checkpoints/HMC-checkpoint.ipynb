        "# Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) Algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that leverages principles from classical mechanics to generate samples from a probability distribution. The core idea is to simulate a physical system where the state of the system evolves according to the laws of physics, and then use that system's trajectory to propose new samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Ideas\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hamiltonian Dynamics**: HMC treats the problem of sampling from a probability distribution as one of simulating a system of particles under Hamiltonian dynamics. \n",
        "- **Momentum Variables**: Introduces auxiliary momentum variables to describe the system's evolution.\n",
        "- **Leapfrog Integration**: Uses a numerical integration method (like leapfrog) to simulate the Hamiltonian dynamics.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of HMC is to generate samples from a target distribution \\( p(x) \\) by defining a **Hamiltonian** function \\( H(x, p) \\), where \\( x \\) represents the position (or state) of the system and \\( p \\) represents the momentum (or auxiliary variables).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hamiltonian Dynamics\n",
        "\n",
        "The Hamiltonian \\( H(x, p) \\) is defined as the sum of two components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Potential Energy**: Based on the target distribution \\( p(x) \\), often taken as \\( U(x) \\) such that \\( p(x) \\propto \\exp(-U(x)) \\).\n",
        "2. **Kinetic Energy**: Based on a standard Gaussian distribution for the momentum variables \\( p \\), often taken as \\( K(p) \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, the Hamiltonian can be written as:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\[\n",
        "H(x, p) = U(x) + K(p)\n",
        "\\]\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "\n",
        "- \\( U(x) = -\\log(p(x)) \\) (the potential energy function).\n",
        "- \\( K(p) = \\frac{1}{2} p^T M^{-1} p \\) (the kinetic energy, with \\( M \\) as the mass matrix, typically chosen to be the identity matrix for simplicity).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Equations of Motion\n",
        "\n",
        "The system evolves according to Hamilton's equations, which describe the time evolution of the position and momentum:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\[\n",
        "\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p}\n",
        "\\]\n",
        "\n",
        "\\[\n",
        "\\frac{dp}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x}\n",
        "\\]\n",
        "\n",
        "These equations describe the rate of change of the position and momentum over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Leapfrog Integration\n",
        "\n",
        "To numerically simulate the system, HMC uses the **leapfrog integration scheme** to approximate the continuous evolution of the system. This method involves alternating updates between position and momentum:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Half-step update of momentum**:\n",
        "   \\[\n",
        "   p_{\\frac{1}{2}} = p - \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} \\frac{\\partial U(x)}{\\partial x}\n",
        "   \\]\n",
        "2. **Full-step update of position**:\n",
        "   \\[\n",
        "   x' = x + \\epsilon M^{-1} p_{\\frac{1}{2}}\n",
        "   \\]\n",
        "3. **Half-step update of momentum**:\n",
        "   \\[\n",
        "   p' = p_{\\frac{1}{2}} - \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} \\frac{\\partial U(x')}{\\partial x}\n",
        "   \\]\n",
        "\n",
        "Where \\( \\epsilon \\) is the step size (or integration time step), and \\( M^{-1} \\) is typically the identity matrix if we assume unit mass.\n",
        "\n",
        "### HMC Algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "The full HMC algorithm proceeds as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial position \\( x_0 \\).\n",
        "2. **Momentum Sampling**: Sample a momentum \\( p_0 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, M) \\) (Gaussian distribution).\n",
        "3. **Leapfrog Integration**: Perform \\( L \\) leapfrog steps to obtain a proposed new state \\( (x', p') \\).\n",
        "4. **Metropolis Acceptance Step**: Accept the proposed state with probability:\n",
        "   \\[\n",
        "   \\alpha = \\min\\left( 1, \\exp(-H(x', p') + H(x_0, p_0)) \\right)\n",
        "   \\]\n",
        "   If accepted, set \\( x_0 = x' \\). If rejected, keep \\( x_0 \\) unchanged.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Full Algorithm\n",
